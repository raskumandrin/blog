<p>The purpose of the trip to Bologna was an aikido seminar taking place there (described below), but the city was memorable for its beauty of endless galleries along the streets.</p>

<p>The galleries of Bologna are a remarkable feature of the city that immediately catches the eye. Kilometers of arches stretch along the streets, protecting passersby from rain and sun. Under them, you can walk for hours, admiring the architecture and feeling a sense of comfort. These arches are not just decoration; they are an important part of city life that makes Bologna unique. You won't find anything quite like this in other cities.</p>

<p>The aparthotel <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/almarossa.en-gb.html">Almarossa</a>, where we stayed, was very enjoyable.
I later left this review on Booking:</p>

<p>Traveling with a child, we found everything we needed for a relaxing and enjoyable several-day stay. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>We had a fantastic stay here! The location is ideal ‚Äì just a 20-minute walk to the station, with easy access to the airport, and only 10 minutes to the city center. The room was easy to access, and having wash and dry machines on the bottom floor was a huge convenience. We especially appreciated the option for a late checkout, which made our departure day much easier. The sheets were very comfortable, and the shower was perfect.</p>

<p>The price for a child on the bus in Bologna: if the child is shorter than one meter, they ride for free; if they are taller, they pay the adult fare üë∫</p>

<p>There is a wider variety of dried fish at MIX Markt; you won't find anything like it in Novi Sad.</p>

<p>Hiroshi Tada is an outstanding aikido master whose name is known worldwide. His students appreciate him for his profound understanding of the philosophy of martial arts and his refined technique. He has dedicated his life not only to practice but also to teaching, inspiring his followers to strive for harmony between body, mind, and the surrounding world.</p>

<p>It was amazing to see how much life energy Hiroshi Tada has. At 94 years old, not only did he travel across half the world, but he also effortlessly executed techniques on the tatami, working with partners who are one and a half times larger than him.</p>

<p>Between seminar sessions, the kimonos are drying on the fence. It's the second of November, and the temperature in the sun is around twenty degrees.</p>
