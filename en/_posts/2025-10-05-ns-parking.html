<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I request clarification on the parking payment rules.</p>

<p>If a vehicle was first parked in the red zone and then, before the paid hour expired, was moved and parked in the blue zone, is it necessary to pay separately for parking in the blue zone, or does the already paid time from the red zone remain valid?</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if you could also point out the official rule clause or provide a link to the section of the regulations where this is stated.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>...</p>

<p>Dear ...,</p>

<p>If you have paid for parking in the red zone and your SMS message is still valid, and during this time you moved to the blue zone, you do not need to pay for the blue zone. This is because the red zone has a higher priority, and during inspection, your vehicle will be registered as having paid for parking.</p>

<p>However, if you paid for parking in the blue zone and then moved to a zone with a higher priority (red or extra), the system will not recognize your payment, as you paid for a lower priority zone but are located in a higher priority one. In this case, you need to pay for the zone you are actually in.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>...</p>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response. Everything is clear and corresponds to how I expected the system should work.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, from a formal point of view, we are talking about reparking in a different zone under a different sign. I ask you to provide me with any officially published and publicly available document that describes this specific case and can be considered normative.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>...</p>
