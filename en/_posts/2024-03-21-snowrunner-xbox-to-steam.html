<p>I was mostly concerned about whether it would be possible to transfer my progress of 58 days, 2 hours, and 18 minutes (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ) from Xbox to Steam. I did some googling beforehand but couldn't find a straightforward guide saying, "do this, then that, and it'll all work out."</p>
<p style="font-size: 120%">But it worked out!</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot from Steam after the transfer. All achievements also transferred.</p>

<h3>The procedure looked like this:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Purchased SnowRunner on both platforms, including the first, second, and third years.</li>
    <li>Registered with PROS.</li>
    <li>From the in-game menu on both platforms, linked to PROS via QR code.</li>
    <li>Selected "send save to PROS" on Xbox.</li>
    <li>On the PROS website, selected "Save Transfer" ‚Äî three screenshots in the post header.</li>
    <li>Launched the game on Steam:
    <br>‚Äî Looks like your save has been pulled in here. Apply?
    <br>‚Äî Apply
    <br>‚Äî Done</li>
    </ol>
