<p>In the world of software development, particularly in multi-team projects, effective inter-team communication plays a crucial role in the project's success. One tool that can significantly facilitate this process is Sequence diagrams.</p>

<h2>Why are Sequence diagrams needed in the first place?</h2>

<p>Sequence diagrams are graphical representations of the interactions between different components or participants in a system over time. They help developers visualize the sequence of method or function calls during the execution of specific functionality. This not only facilitates understanding of the system's operation but also helps identify potential issues or suboptimal execution paths.</p>

<h2>Why is it more convenient to write them as code?</h2>

<p>At first, I used to draw such diagrams in draw.io. It was quite tedious overall.</p>

<p><a class="fresco" href="{{ page.i }}sso_diagram.png"><img src="{{ page.i }}sso_diagram.th.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="{{ page.i }}sso_diagram.drawio">sso_diagram.drawio</a></p>

<p>Then I discovered PlantUML. Writing the first diagram using text was also quite tedious, just like drawing in draw.io. But when it came to making changes and creating other similar diagrams, that's when the advantages of diagrams in the form of code, rather than drawings, became fully apparent.</p>
<dl>

<dt>Clarity and Precision</dt>
<dd>Using PlantUML to write Sequence diagrams as code ensures high clarity and precision in describing interactions between components. The code in PlantUML is formalized and strict, eliminating potential ambiguities or misunderstandings in interpreting the diagrams.</dd>
<dt>Integration with Documentation</dt>
<dd>Sequence diagrams created in PlantUML easily integrate into project documentation, such as Confluence. This provides convenient access to visual representations of system architecture and component interactions for all project participants.</dd>
<dt>Version Control</dt>
<dd>PlantUML enables tracking changes in diagrams and controlling their versioning. This is useful when working with Confluence, as it allows preserving the history of changes and quickly restoring previous versions of diagrams when necessary.</dd>
<dt>Ease of Editing and Creating Subsequent Diagrams</dt>
<dd>Because Sequence diagrams in PlantUML are represented as code, editing becomes a simple and quick process. Additionally, based on existing code, creating subsequent diagrams is easy, contributing to time savings and enhancing team efficiency.</dd>

<p>"I would consider the lack of flexibility in styling presentation as one of the drawbacks of diagram coding.</p>

<h2>PlantUML</h2>

<p>You can start coding/drawing the diagram in the browser:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000">https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000</a></p>

<p>If the content of the diagram is sensitive in terms of confidentiality, you can run PlantUML locally through Docker, and the same interface in the browser will be available locally and without internet access.</p>

<h2>Request numbering</h2>
<p>Diagrams are primarily needed to design and agree upon a technical solution between teams on one hand, and on the other hand, to troubleshoot issues and address them to the relevant team during the operation of the implemented technical solution.<p>
	
<p>For both scenarios, request numbering on the diagram is extremely helpful. If requests are numbered, communication often involves phrases like 'request 11 sends such-and-such data to your team's service, and in response, 12 unexpectedly returns certain data.' This helps avoid convoluted and lengthy constructs such as 'when the service of that team sends a request to your team's service.<p>
